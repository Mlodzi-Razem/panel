=== Scaling Roadmap

Panel's backend component, `panel-api`, does not support
horizontal scaling, thus not supporting high availability
and rolling upgrades.
Lack of scaling support has not been an issue so far,
but here is the list of steps that need to be completed
for horizontal scaling to be possible.

| Description                     | Rationale                                  | Implemented

| External cache support          | Required to provide consistency            | ❌
| External message broker support | Required for event-based architecture
                                    to be able to handle multiple replicas
                                    without consistency issues and losing
                                    data.                                      | ❌
